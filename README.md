To manage and sync user authentication with Shopify while using a custom authentication (like Firebase or any backend-based system), you'll need to set up a flow where authenticated users in your system can interact with Shopify’s data securely and, ideally, map their accounts to Shopify customer profiles if needed.

Here's a structured approach to achieve that:

### 1. **Link Your Authentication System with Shopify Customers**

Shopify's Storefront API allows for some customer management through its Customer API. This means you can map authenticated users in your app to Shopify customers, letting you perform actions like retrieving order history, viewing saved addresses, or managing cart items. Here’s the general flow:

- **Sign Up / Register**: When a user signs up or logs in on your site, check if they already have a corresponding Shopify customer account using their email.

  - If they do, fetch and store the Shopify customer ID associated with that email.
  - If they don't, create a new Shopify customer record and store the returned customer ID in your database.

- **Update Shopify Customer Records**: On events like profile updates or new account creation, you can update the corresponding Shopify customer data through Shopify’s Customer API.

### 2. **Storefront API: Authenticate Users and Fetch Customer Data**

Shopify’s Storefront API supports customer authentication through a unique token. This can be combined with your backend’s authentication to access Shopify customer-specific data.

- **Authenticate Customer on Shopify**: Once your user logs in, you can use Shopify’s `customerAccessTokenCreate` mutation to generate a Shopify customer access token.
- **Store the Customer Access Token**: Once obtained, store the Shopify customer token securely (e.g., in a database or a secure client-side storage like cookies if used only client-side).

**Example of customer authentication via Storefront API**:

```javascript
const customerLogin = async (email, password) => {
  const query = `
        mutation customerAccessTokenCreate($email: String!, $password: String!) {
            customerAccessTokenCreate(input: { email: $email, password: $password }) {
                customerAccessToken {
                    accessToken
                    expiresAt
                }
                userErrors {
                    field
                    message
                }
            }
        }
    `;

  const response = await fetch(SHOPIFY_GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token": SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables: { email, password } }),
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  if (result.data.customerAccessTokenCreate.customerAccessToken) {
    return result.data.customerAccessTokenCreate.customerAccessToken
      .accessToken;
  } else {
    throw new Error(
      result.data.customerAccessTokenCreate.userErrors[0].message
    );
  }
};
```

- **Use the Access Token to Fetch Customer Data**: With the customer’s access token, you can query for specific customer data like order history, profile info, and saved addresses.

### 3. **Handle Authentication State and Sync with Your App**

Once your user is authenticated both on your backend and in Shopify, use the Shopify token to retrieve customer-specific data as needed. Here are some ways to use it effectively:

- **Fetch Customer Orders**: Query orders, cart items, and other customer-specific details.
- **Sync Profile Changes**: If a user updates their profile information, ensure these changes are reflected both in Shopify (using Shopify's `customerUpdate` mutation) and in your app’s backend.

### 4. **Example Workflow: Login with Shopify Customer Account + Sync with Custom Backend**

Here’s how the login flow might look:

1. **User Logs in**: They authenticate via your system (e.g., Firebase or custom backend).
2. **Check Shopify Customer Account**: On successful authentication, check if the user has a corresponding Shopify customer account by querying Shopify.
3. **Get Customer Access Token**:
   - If they have a Shopify account, fetch the `customerAccessToken` for them.
   - If they don’t have a Shopify account, create one using their email and password and store their Shopify customer ID.
4. **Save Customer Access Token Securely**: Store this token securely in the client or server-side storage.
5. **Fetch and Sync Data**: Use the customer token to access customer-specific endpoints on Shopify and sync with your backend data as needed.

### 5. **Sample Code to Create or Fetch Shopify Customer and Store Access Token**

Below is a generalized example that combines these ideas.

```javascript
// Check if Shopify Customer Exists, or Create a New Customer
const getOrCreateShopifyCustomer = async (email, password) => {
  let shopifyToken;

  try {
    // Try logging in as an existing Shopify customer
    shopifyToken = await customerLogin(email, password);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes("Customer does not exist")) {
      // Customer not found, create a new one
      shopifyToken = await createShopifyCustomer(email, password);
    } else {
      throw error;
    }
  }

  return shopifyToken;
};

// Create a new customer in Shopify
const createShopifyCustomer = async (email, password) => {
  const query = `
        mutation customerCreate($input: CustomerCreateInput!) {
            customerCreate(input: $input) {
                customer {
                    id
                }
                customerUserErrors {
                    field
                    message
                }
            }
        }
    `;

  const variables = {
    input: {
      email,
      password,
    },
  };

  const response = await fetch(SHOPIFY_GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token": SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables }),
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  if (result.data.customerCreate.customer) {
    return await customerLogin(email, password); // Login after creation
  } else {
    throw new Error(result.data.customerCreate.customerUserErrors[0].message);
  }
};
```

### 6. **Logout Functionality**

Simply delete the Shopify customer access token from your app’s storage to “log out” of Shopify. If you’re syncing with a backend, also clear the session on the server.

### 7. **Security and Best Practices**

- **Secure Tokens**: Always secure your Shopify customer tokens, ideally using HTTP-only cookies if handling tokens server-side.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Handle token expiration gracefully, as Shopify tokens have expiry. You might need to re-authenticate if the token expires.
- **Error Handling**: Shopify’s APIs will return errors if there’s an issue with the token or permissions. Handle these errors gracefully, particularly on expired tokens or permissions issues.

This setup provides a way to let authenticated users access their Shopify account data while managing authentication independently on your own backend or with a third-party provider.
